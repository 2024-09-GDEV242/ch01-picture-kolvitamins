It is discussed in chapter 1.
    
This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.

This picture depicts a person visiting a museum to see Piet Mondrain's
Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow, 1930. They are giving a thumbs
up because they are a connoisseur of Bauhaus.
